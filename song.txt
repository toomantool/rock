Take me by the hand
The sun goes down again
In your cold eyes
I saw an empty street
I saw the blood red sky
So come with me tonight
There is nothig I can do with my feelings
There are so many mistakes I’ve done before
Everytime you rise
I am slowly falling
Girl what are you looking for
What are you looking for
Last train to your heart
Arrives at 5: 19
I am standing here
I am just too sullen guy
Under your blood red sky
So come with me tonight
I am falling
There is nothig I can do with my feelings
There are so many mistakes I’ve done before
Everytime you rise
I am slowly falling
Girl what are you looking for
What are you looking for
